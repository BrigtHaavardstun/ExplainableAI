\chapter{Model}

In this thesis there are multiple "models" and we will therefor establish cleare notations and descriptions of 
of each.

\section{$\theta{ai}$ - the AI}

With $\theta{ai}$ we refere to the AI model we are trying to teach to a human. 
In this thesis we will experimented with two different implementations of $\theta{ai}$. 
One being a convolutional nural network, refered to as $CNN$, and the other being a fully connected nural network, refrenced to as $NN$.

\section{$\theta{LM}$ - modeling human learner}
