In todays society AI and machine learning is becoming more and more relevant. (find source) For instance, some might say the age old problem of the
protein folding has finally been solved thanks to Deep mind and their Alphafold 2 (source). Their deep learning approach achieved close to 90\% accuray,
matching experimental approaches. However, even if we now can get greatly accurat approximation solutions to the question of protein folding, the question of
how each protein fold into their 3D structure has not been solved yet. Motivated by this fact that knowing solutions to instances not nessecery gives insight 
to the question a large, as well as the expaning use of AI in our everday life [netflix, recommendation systems]. This places Explaineable AI as a topic of
of extrem relevancy in the comming years.
