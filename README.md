# ExplainableAI
This projects holds the master thesis of Brigt Arve Toppe HÃ¥vardstun. In the master thesis we will discuss a new approach in Explainable AI, where we try to find the most significant data to explain how our model is working. 

In this github we will create a dummy example. We will train three MLs to try to modle a boolean function, where input is a image of literals set to true in the boolean function.
