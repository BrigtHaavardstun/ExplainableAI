\chapter{Dataset}

In this chapter we discuss how the dataset was choosen, how we create it, and the different parameters 
acceseable when creating it. 

\section{Background}

In deciding how to layout our dataset our first choice was in desciding the task our AI was going to learn.
Something to take into concideration when selecting the task for the AI was that we wanted something simple to
implement and tweak while still having some challange to an AI.
We chose the task of predicting a boolean function given bitmaps of literals with value true. 
This was done [beacuse!].
