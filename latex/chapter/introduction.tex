\chapter{Introduction}

In this master thesis we implement and discuss the result of the propsed model 
for machine teaching. 

\section{Background}
This master thesis is connected to the reasearch of \{citation or refrence on research proposal\}.
In their research proposal they put forward a formula for machine teaching \ref{Machine Teaching-formula}. 

\begin{equation}
    \label{Machine Teaching-formula}
    \centering
    T(\Theta_{AI})=\argmin_{S: \Theta_{AI} \models S} \{\delta(S)+\lambda (\Theta_{AI}, \Theta_M):L_M(S)=\Theta_M\}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{LM-formula}
    \centering
    L_M(S)=\argmin_{\Theta_M :\Theta_M \models S} \{\beta(\Theta_M)\}
\end{equation}

In this thesis we discuss different implementations of \ref{Machine Teaching-formula}. In particular we discuss
different definitions of $\delta$,$\lambda$, $L_M$, the selection of subsets $S$ and selection of $\Theta_M$.
